# Roland TR-808 Web App

This project initially began as my final project for Sounth Synthesis & Signal Processing, where I recreated a functioning Roland TR-808 in MaxMSP.  As I began to learn more about web development, I decided that I wanted to challenge myself by creating a similar application that could run in a browser.  My research led me to p5.js, a JavaScript library that focuses on creating audio and visual art with code.  I fell in love with this creative form of coding and used p5 in order to build this page, along with some vanilla CSS for styling.
